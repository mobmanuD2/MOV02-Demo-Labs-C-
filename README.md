## Key Differences between C++ and Objective C

*let us discuss some of the major differences:*


 - C++ is a middle-level language that is being run on various cross-platform operating systems such as Windows, UNIX, Macintosh OS, etc. whereas Objective C is a general-purpose object-oriented programming language used by Apple in its operating systems and APIs Cocoa, etc.
 - C++ supports data hiding, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism and also has main core components like Standard Template Library (STL) whereas Objective C also supports the same features as C++ except for STL and includes foundational frameworks.
 - C++ supports portability which has ANSI (American National Standards Institute) standard which is being supported by the major C++ IDE manufacturers whereas Objective C has different data types, tokens to recognize the identifiers, declarations and assignments and pre-processor to define constants.
 - C++ supports different operators such as Arithmetic Operators, Logical Operators, Bitwise Operators, Relational Operators, Assignment Operators, and Miscellaneous Operators and Objective C also supports the same operators and pre-processors which are not the part of the compilation process.
 - C++ supports Files and Streams, Exception Handling, Dynamic memory, Namespaces, Templates, Pre-processors, and Multi-threading, etc. whereas Objective C supports Posing, Extensions, Dynamic Binding, Protocols, Composite Objects, Memory Management, and Enumerations.
 - C++ has features such as Namespaces, References, Templates, implicit method overloading whereas Objective C allows dynamic dispatch, auto-generation of accessors to access member variables and properties and allows a method and a name to share the same identifier.
 - In C++, calling a method will be decided at compile time whereas in Objective C, calling a method will be decided at runtime and also Objective C has special features like adding or replacing methods like on a class that already exists.
 - In C++, objects are null and cannot be handled safely in all cases where a dereference is used, then a Run-Time error will be thrown whereas Objective C has nil which can be safely handled in a powerful way by safely sending messages to nil objects.
 - In C++, operator overloading is supported and is more portable and simple whereas Objective C does not support default parameters but can be implemented by multiple methods manipulation and also do not support private members.
 - In C++, the memory is allocated during runtime at the heap of the objects whereas Objective C does not support stack-based memory objects and allocating memory in Objective C is very expensive and it plays a key role in writing successful programs for the delivery of efficient applications.
 - In C++, class objects are declared normally and are similar to that of general object-oriented programming languages whereas Objective C has a composite object feature that has an embedded object inside an object, which means a private cluster object will be embedded into the main object along with some primitive methods.
 - In C++, the Standard Library contains two parts which are Standard Function Library and Object-Oriented Class Library whereas Objective C has a Fast Enumeration feature where collections are core components of this feature.

| Basis Of Comparison  | C++                                                        | Objective C                                                      |
| :---                 |  :---                                                      | :---                                                   |
| Design               | 	It was designed to be object-oriented and procedural      |  It was designed to be object-oriented along with the Smalltalk messaging feature.|
| Inheritance          |	It allows multiple inheritances                           |  It does not allow multiple inheritances                           |
| Paradigm 	           |  It uses methods to call the implemented functionalities   |  It uses messages to call the implemented functionalities as it was implemented based on Smalltalk messaging|
| Classes 	           |  Structs and classes are the same in C++ 	                |  Structs and classes are treated  differently in Objective C       |
| License 	           |  It is open source project 2.0                             |	It is licensed under GPL (General Public License)                 |
| Type 	               |  It is static typing                                       |	It is dynamic typing                                              |
| Polymorphism 	       |  Parametric polymorphism in C++ is checked at compile time |  Parametric polymorphism in Objective C is checked at compile time |
| Boolean Operators 	 |  C++ uses true, false and bool                             |	C++ uses YES, NO and BOOL                                         |
| Templates 	         |  C++ has STL (Standard Template Library) libraries         |	Objective C lacks template libraries                              |
